<p>The Bitcoin network was established in 2009, but not until 2010 it received the first documented pessimism about Bitcoin. Let's look at each end-of-year articles curated in <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/">99bitcoins</a> and weigh their present relevance. </p>

<p>The blog, alongside with the post, is no longer online. Last capture from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181005185752/https://undergroundeconomist.com/post/1528511369">The Wayback Machine</a> states that the OP changed his opinion about Bitcoin and linked his answer to a Quora question, which has changed for the last eight years. Instead of showing his answers, Quora showed the question which has 100+ answers and it's very time-consuming to find his answer... assuming it's still there.<br>Date &amp; price: Dec 15 2010,  $0.23</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The underlying vulnerabilities that led to bitcoin's troubles—its dependence on unregulated, centralized exchanges and online wallets—persist.

<p>Exchange are become more regulated, and for the first time institutional investor have an option to become a market participant (Bakkt and CME). And the theoretical 51% attack has never happened on Bitcoin since pool operators have incentive to keep the network healthy.</p>

<p>This year marked the turning point for companies with weak conviction on bitcoin. Circle and BitPay are no longer a relevant player in bitcoin space. The titular company, Uphold, fares slightly better although the amount of their customer is eclipsed by other companies in similar sector.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If currencies are fundamentally tribal, how can Bitcoin possibly become the “new gold standard”, as maximalists dream? Humans don’t take kindly to attempts by other tribes to eliminate their tribal symbols and impose those of another tribe. They have to be persuaded, not coerced. Currently, Bitcoin maximalists can’t even persuade other Bitcoiners to support their coin. The idea that they could persuade all the people of the world to throw away their tribal currencies and adopt their version of Bitcoin is laughable. When’s the next fork, by the way? </p><p>Bitcoin has shown us the tribal nature of currencies. For that, we should be grateful. But Bitcoin becoming the One True Currency for the whole world?

<p>There is no submission (yet) for December 2019 in <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/">99bitcoins </a>but here is my favorite FUD. Hat tip to John Carvalho.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The main worry is that these attacks could be performed with the current version of Lightning and there are few steps to prevent them. The proof of concept the researchers built, with 100 live C&amp;C servers, is running on the network today. They didn’t need to modify the Lightning network at all to create it. And, the paper stated, Lightning developers are working on adding a feature that would make botnets even harder to destroy.</p></blockquote>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The harder it is to takedown the network, the better. Messaging over LN is awesome and has potential applications. Botnets already exist before LN does and it is up to the user to exercise security measure to prevent their machine from becoming a bot.</p>
